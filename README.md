How to Save Shopify Contact Form Data to Google Sheetsâ€¦?

It's very simple and quick if you follow my guide. This setup needs to be done in 2 steps:

- Setup googlesheets to accept data.
- Setup Shopify contact form to send data.

I'll cover both steps in detail in below Youtube video so make sure you watch it till the end. If you still have a question or if you want me to set it up for you, then feel free to contact me through my UpWork profile or my website https://www.waqarulhassan.com
